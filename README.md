# analyse_query_string
To analyse the params on some websites and get the string format you can put directly into a dictionary with python

You can analyse the params from either the command line or a file. 
The default program is to get params from the command line, but you can remove the comment sign '#' to define your own file passed to function "get_str" which you put the params into in order to transform to string format which has "" quotation marks on it. 
You may choose either way to analyse base on how large the query string parameters within headers of the website are or how many parameters it have.
What's more, you can import the file or run the file directly with python, also you can edit and extend the function for more use by yourself :)
